# BladeRunner2049-Animation-Project
This is one of very first Projects I developed for my Animation Assignment during my 1st Year at Waterford Institute of Technology using Java Processing 3 for my Programming Fundamentals I Module. The Java Processing Software can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/download/). This project was greatly inspired by one of my favourite Science-Fiction Movie called 'BladeRunner 2049' directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. A sequel to the 1982 film Blade Runner.
